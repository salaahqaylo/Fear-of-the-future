# Fear-of-the-future
Why are people afraid of the artificial intelligence revolution?

With every new invention man creates to ease his life,new worries rise form the effect of this technology on his lifestyle tha he's used to.
For example, 1986, agroup of Mathematics teacher in Washington (USA) were protesting against letting students use calculator, arising their worry that the spread of these devices would destroy students' calculation abilities, and rusting their brain it wasn't just restructed to protests in the 19th century, during the industrialization revolution in Britain, agroup appeared that objected on machine use in factories, they used to break into factories and samash the expensiv machines to force the owners of the factories to save their money and stop buying them.
  Contrary to what your might think, my friend 
the members of these groups weren't criminals or thugs, no , they were handicraft men who feared losing their jobs to machinery.
And now in 2024 we no longer have this fear, students learn how to use calculators in schools they even have cheat sheets written on the back of them.
Also ,most of goods we use come from factories with machinery, depite that, we still have similar fears .
A revolution that started in the fifties the Artificial intelligence.
Opinios on Artificial Intelligence (Al) can be divided into two teams, one that sees Al as a threat to many jobs, and will lead to unemployment just like what machinery did in the industrialization.
And the other sees it as an unreasonable fear, and that if Al took apart of our jobs, and maybe even more than before, again just like post-industrialization.
But what both sides agreed on without a doubt, that Al still had a long way to go till it becomes smart enought to replace man.
Its easy gor you to know the steps you need to produce a juice box, and make  a machine that does these steps.
But it's hard to know  the steps that apoet needs to write poetry.
Or the steps an engineer need to deaing a building' and make a machine do that same jab and excel at.
It's all mental processe ,its hard to make formulas for these.
What both sides agreen on, was that some jabs have man element,  and it's still too far for Al to take this role.
But in late November 2022, an importtant event happened, that made both sides recalculate their views.
This event was Open AI company's announacement of Chat GPT
